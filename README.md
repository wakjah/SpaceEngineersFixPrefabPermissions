# SpaceEngineersFixPrefabPermissions

Fixes that in recent versions of SE you can convert economy prefab stations to ships (by sitting in a passenger seat and accessing the terminal) and then steal them by pushing them out of the safe zone.

With this mod, you can still click the button, but it doesn't do anything.

Converting stations that do not have a store block to ships is still allowed, so you can still capture maydays and take them away.
