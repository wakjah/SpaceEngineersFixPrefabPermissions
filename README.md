# SpaceEngineersFixPrefabPermissions

Fixes that in recent versions of SE you can convert economy prefab stations to ships (by sitting in a passenger seat and accessing the terminal) and then steal them by pushing them out of the safe zone.

See https://clips.twitch.tv/ElatedCheerfulHorseradishFunRun-LgCMqc4YaM8kXsxX for an example of this being done in-game.

With this mod, you can still click the button, but it doesn't do anything.

Converting stations that do not have a store block to ships is still allowed, so you can still capture maydays and take them away.
